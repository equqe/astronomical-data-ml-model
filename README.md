# astronomical-data-ml-model
model based on an opensource astronomical dataset 

astroml+astropy, jupyter, numpy, matplotlib, scipy ... (the list is not full still)

the model uses SDSS quasars dataset, which includes right ascension, declination, redshift, the magnitude and its error(g+r+i+z, 2MASS J+H+K) and spectral object identifier of the quasar

dataset: https://classic.sdss.org/dr7/products/value_added/qsocat_dr7.php
